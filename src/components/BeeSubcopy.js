          <p className="text">Bosnak finds that meditation is especially necessary in this modern age. "It is an incredible way to slow down the chattering mind, the monkey mind, and to really understand the possibility that lives within you," she says. "The process of meditating helps you to truly wake up." Try carving out 15 to 20 minutes each day. "It takes about that long for your mind to calm down," she explains, noting that she loves to use essential oils to aid this process.</p>
